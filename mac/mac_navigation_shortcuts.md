**general Mac keyboard shortcuts**

---

## 🔹 App Switching & Navigation

* **Switch between apps** → `⌘ Command + Tab`
  (Hold `⌘` and keep tapping `Tab` to cycle, or hold `Shift` too to go backward)
* **Toggle between last 2 apps** → `⌘ Command + Tab` (just tap once, release immediately)
* **Switch between windows of the same app** → `⌘ Command + ~` (tilde, above Tab key)
  👉 Useful when you have multiple browser or editor windows open
* **Open Spotlight search (launch apps/files quickly)** → `⌘ Command + Space`
* **Open Mission Control (all windows, desktops)** → `Control + ↑`
* **Switch between desktops/spaces** → `Control + →` or `Control + ←`

---

## 🔹 Browser (Chrome / Safari / Edge)

* **Switch tabs left/right** → `Control + Tab` (or `Control + Shift + Tab` to go backward)
  ⬆️ Works in most browsers
* **Switch directly to a tab by number** → `⌘ Command + 1` … `⌘ Command + 9`

  * `⌘ + 9` always jumps to the **last tab**
* **New tab** → `⌘ Command + T`
* **Close tab** → `⌘ Command + W`
* **Reopen last closed tab** → `⌘ Command + Shift + T`
* **New window** → `⌘ Command + N`
* **New incognito/private window** → `⌘ Command + Shift + N`
* **Open link in new tab (background)** → `⌘ Command + Click`
* **Open link in new window** → `Shift + ⌘ Command + Click`

---

## 🔹 Window Management

* **Hide current app** → `⌘ Command + H`
* **Minimize current window** → `⌘ Command + M`
* **Close current window** → `⌘ Command + W`
* **Quit app completely** → `⌘ Command + Q`
* **Cycle through minimized windows in Dock** → `Control + F3` then arrow keys

---

⚡ Pro Tip: Combine `⌘ + Tab` (switch apps) with `⌘ + ~` (switch windows within same app) for **super-fast navigation** between browsers, IDEs, and terminals.

command + ~ does not work if other windows are minimized

---

When you **minimize a window** (⌘ + M), it goes into the Dock and macOS doesn’t treat it as an “active window” for `⌘ + ~` cycling. That’s why you can’t toggle to it.

### ✅ Workarounds:

1. **Don’t minimize — hide instead**

   * Use `⌘ + H` → hides the app but keeps all windows available.
   * Then `⌘ + Tab` → reopens it instantly (with the last active window).
   * Benefit: windows stay in the `⌘ + ~` cycle.

2. **Use Mission Control** (`Control + ↑`)

   * Shows all windows (even minimized ones).
   * Pick the one you want with arrow keys + Enter (or mouse if faster).

3. **Cycle Dock windows with keyboard**

   * `Control + F3` → takes focus to Dock.
   * Use arrow keys to select minimized app window.
   * Press `↑` (to show window) + Enter.

🔹 **Pro tip refinement for you:**
Instead of minimizing windows, try using **⌘ + H (Hide)**. It feels like minimizing but keeps the window in your quick toggle flow (`⌘ + Tab` + `⌘ + ~`). Much smoother for productivity.

---

arrow keys not switching focus to opened apps/windows in mission control

By default, **Mission Control (`Control + ↑`)** shows all your open windows, but **keyboard focus doesn’t move between them** with arrow keys unless you change a setting.
