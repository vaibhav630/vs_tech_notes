# Sharing Skills

## What you'll learn

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes

By the end of this lesson you'll be able to:

- Share skills with your team by committing them to a Git repository  
- Distribute skills across projects through plugins and marketplaces  
- Deploy skills organization-wide using enterprise managed settings  
- Configure custom subagents to use specific skills

# Sharing Skills (4 minutes)

Skills become much more valuable when they're shared across a team or organization.

This video covers the three main distribution methods — repository commits, plugins, and enterprise managed settings — and explains how to configure custom subagents to use skills.

You'll learn which approach fits which scenario and how to handle an important gotcha: subagents don't inherit skills automatically.

---

# Key Takeaways

- Project skills in `.claude/skills` are shared automatically through Git — anyone who clones the repo gets them  
- Plugins let you distribute skills across repositories via marketplaces for broader community use  
- Enterprise managed settings deploy skills organization-wide with the highest priority, ideal for mandatory standards and compliance  
- Subagents don't automatically see your skills — you must explicitly list skills in a custom agent's frontmatter `skills` field  
- Built-in agents (Explorer, Plan, Verify) can't access skills at all — only custom subagents defined in `.claude/agents` can

Skills become much more valuable when they're shared.

A PR review skill that only you use is helpful, but that same skill shared across your entire team standardizes code review and creates a consistent experience across your organization.

Let's look at the different ways you can distribute skills.

---

# Committing Skills to Your Repository

The simplest sharing method is committing skills directly to your repository.

Place them in `.claude/skills`, and anyone who clones the repo gets those skills automatically — no extra installation needed.

When you push updates, everyone gets them on the next pull.

---

## This approach works well for:

- Team coding standards  
- Project-specific workflows  
- Skills that reference your codebase structure  

---

The `.claude` directory contains your agents, hooks, skills, and settings — all version-controlled and shared with the team through normal Git workflows.

---

# Distributing Skills Through Plugins

Plugins are a way to extend Claude Code with custom functionality designed to be shared across teams and projects.

In your plugin project, create a `skills` directory that follows a similar file structure to the `.claude` directory — each skill gets its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside.

After you distribute your plugin to a marketplace, other users can discover and install it into Claude Code for themselves.

---

This approach is best when your skills aren't too project-specific and can be useful to community members beyond your immediate team.

---

# Enterprise Deployment Through Managed Settings

Administrators can deploy skills organization-wide through managed settings.

Enterprise skills take the highest priority — they override personal, project, and plugin skills with the same name.

---

## Example: Managed Settings Configuration

```json
"strictKnownMarketplaces": [
  {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
  },
  {
    "source": "npm",
    "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
  }
]
````

---

This is the right choice for:

* Mandatory standards
* Security requirements
* Compliance workflows
* Coding practices that must be consistent across the organization

The keyword here is **"must."**

# Skills and Subagents

Here's something that surprises people:

👉 Subagents don't automatically see your skills.

When you delegate a task to a subagent, it starts with a fresh, clean context.

---

## Important distinctions

* Built-in agents (like Explorer, Plan, and Verify) can't access skills at all
* Custom subagents you define can use skills, but only when you explicitly list them
* Skills are loaded when the subagent starts, not on demand like in the main conversation

---

# Creating a Custom Subagent with Skills

To create a custom subagent with skills:

* Add an agent markdown file in `.claude/agents`
* Or use the `/agents` command in Claude Code

---

## Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: frontend-security-accessibility-reviewer
description: "Use this agent when you need to review frontend code for accessibility..."
tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill...
model: sonnet
color: blue
skills: accessibility-audit, performance-check
---
```

---

When you delegate to this subagent, it has both skills loaded and applies them to every review.

First make sure the skills exist in your `.claude/skills` directory, then either:

* Create a new subagent
* Or add the `skills` field to an existing agent's markdown file

---

# When This Pattern Works Well

* You want isolated task delegation with specific expertise
* Different subagents need different skills (frontend reviewer vs. backend reviewer)
* You want to enforce standards in delegated work without relying on prompts

```
