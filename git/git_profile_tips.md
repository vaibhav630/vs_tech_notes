👍 — your **GitHub profile** is like your portfolio and first impression for recruiters, collaborators, or open-source communities. Here’s what you should ideally specify:

---

## 🔑 **Essentials for Your GitHub Profile**

1. **Profile Picture** – A clean professional photo (or a neat avatar if you want a bit of personality).
2. **Name & Username** – Use your real name if you’re showcasing professional work.
3. **Bio** – A short one-liner about who you are and what you do.
4. **Location** – Helps recruiters know where you’re based.
5. **Company / Current Role** – Your current employer or role, e.g. QA Engineer @ abc.
6. **Link** – To LinkedIn, personal website, or portfolio.

## 📝 **Optional but Recommended**

* **Pinned Repositories** → Pin 4–6 that show your best work (automation frameworks, test utilities, open-source contributions).
* **Profile README** → You can create a special repo named after your username (`github.com/username/username`). Its `README.md` becomes your profile’s landing section.

  * Add:

    * 👋 Short intro
    * 🛠️ Skills/tech stack badges
    * 📌 Highlights of projects
    * 📫 Contact info

## 🎯 **Extra Tips**

* Keep contributions graph active (even small commits help).
* If possible, contribute to open-source QA/test tools.
* Use GitHub Actions badges (e.g., build passing) to make repos look professional.
* Add **README files in all repos** so anyone can understand the project quickly.
